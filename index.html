                                        <li>Data Collection: depending on their work, users might collect data from experiments or generate input by themselves. Data can take many forms, from numeric values to videos. The amount of data and its complexity may also vary.</li>

                                        <li>Coming up with Algorithms: users need to come up with algorithms that align with their data. Our tools need to help them with this activity.</li>
                                        <li>Experiments/Testing: when scientists need to prove a theory or formula, they need to test their visualization against new data and the visualization needs to update with data. When designers need to validate their prototypes, they can test their prototypes in real scenarios.</li>

                                        <li>Publishing: the generated visualization can be shared with others or published to a platform. And tools should make it easy not only for users to publish, but also for readers to understand/interpret.</li>

                                            <p>My interview isn't an exact interview in the sense that I go find someone and ask them some questions. But I'm still able to observe my "interviewee" and her body of knowledge and experience, and help me build my understaning. I "interviewed" an expert (without her consent, unfortunately), by watching her explaining her work process in a video on YouTube. And I think this "interview" is at least equally (or even more) valuable as a real one.</p>

                                            <p>My findings, preliminary conclusions, and more questions:</p>
                                            <p>- While I find Synthestruct's works are absolutely cool and amazing, the amount of coding and algebraic manipulations she went through in TouchDesigner is enormous.</p>
                                            <p>- For most of her works, the output is light in 3D geometric patterns, and input can vary from brain waves, heartbeat, or dataset that produce organized patterns.</p>
                                            <p>- A lot of effort went into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/hrBfmXunf5s?t=1740">coding dynamic simulations</a>.</p>
                                            <p>So my doubts are:</p> 
                                            <p>- Is it really necessary to abstract the geometric patterns in her brain through so many layers of algebraic representations in TouchDesigner?</p>
                                            <p>- Can we achieve more direct manipulations that do not require artists to translate patterns/drawings/ideas in their heads into all kinds of symbols and parameters in a software?</p>
                                            <p>- Do artists have to code? Or is it just because they have bad tools?</p>

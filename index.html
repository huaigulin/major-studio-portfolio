                                        <li>Data Collection: depending on their work, users might collect data from experiments or generate input by themselves. Data can take many forms, from numeric values to videos. The amount of data and its complexity may also vary.</li>

                                        <li>Coming up with Algorithms: users need to come up with algorithms that align with their data. Our tools need to help them with this activity.</li>
                                        <li>Experiments/Testing: when scientists need to prove a theory or formula, they need to test their visualization against new data and the visualization needs to update with data. When designers need to validate their prototypes, they can test their prototypes in real scenarios.</li>

                                        <li>Publishing: the generated visualization can be shared with others or published to a platform. And tools should make it easy not only for users to publish, but also for readers to understand/interpret.</li>

                                            <p>My interview isn't an exact interview in the sense that I go find someone and ask them some questions. But I'm still able to observe my "interviewee" and her body of knowledge and experience, and help me build my understaning. I "interviewed" an expert (without her consent, unfortunately), by watching her explaining her work process in a video on YouTube. And I think this "interview" is at least equally (or even more) valuable as a real one.</p>

                                            <p>My findings, preliminary conclusions, and more questions:</p>
                                            <p>- While I find Synthestruct's works are absolutely cool and amazing, the amount of coding and algebraic manipulations she went through in TouchDesigner is enormous.</p>
                                            <p>- For most of her works, the output is light in 3D geometric patterns, and input can vary from brain waves, heartbeat, or dataset that produce organized patterns.</p>
                                            <p>- A lot of effort went into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/hrBfmXunf5s?t=1740">coding dynamic simulations</a>.</p>
                                            <p>So my doubts are:</p> 
                                            <p>- Is it really necessary to abstract the geometric patterns in her brain through so many layers of algebraic representations in TouchDesigner?</p>
                                            <p>- Can we achieve more direct manipulations that do not require artists to translate patterns/drawings/ideas in their heads into all kinds of symbols and parameters in a software?</p>
                                            <p>- Do artists have to code? Or is it just because they have bad tools?</p>

                            I really appreciate all the feedbacks that the external critics and my peers had given, they raised questions that I had not thought about before and helped me organize this project around several crucial questions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think for the next few stages of my projects, all the things I need to do are essentially trying to answer 2 questions:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Why do artists and designers need code to begin with?
                            </li>
                            <li>What is the output/experience of my tool?</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            For the first question, I think it is beneficial to draw a line or somewhat distinguish between artists/designers’ work and engineering first. Because in recent experiences of pitching my idea to others, many people would often mistake that my tool would help people build products without any coding at all. This is not true. My tool is impossible to replace all the software developers in the world, and in fact it is not intended to replace any of them. The tool is mainly to help designers and artists to communicate and visualize their ideas to audiences and stakeholders. Therefore, I think it is beneficial to at the beginning of and continuously throughout the project to distinguish between design and engineering. Then we are clear that I want to find out why artists and designers (not engineers) feel that they have to code and how I can help.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then for the first question, my next step is to quantify and categorize the types of work that artists and designers do and their needs. I will interview artists and designers who use coding tools and let them tell stories about how they learned coding and chose the tools that involve coding. This is also related to Daniel’s question of what “materials”, tools, or components are available to artists and what they are working with. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second question is important because picking the right output/experience of my tool is crucial in proving that coding is unnecessary for digital art making. The experience of my tool should prove, like Daniel said, what I am empowering. Therefore, I think it does not need to be comprehensive in ways that the tool is universal and can be used by all kinds of artists and designers. The output that the tool produces just needs to represent typical art works that are produced in new media, which is dynamic and responsive, and the experience of producing the output is a form of direct manipulation involving immediate feedback. The argument is that it might not be possible to get rid of every scenario that requires artists to code, but a better tool could always be made so they do not have to reinvent the wheels every time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To answer the second question, I think Aaron’s feedback of looking into architectural tools that are user-centered is really helpful, because it can inform me on what a good user experience could look like.

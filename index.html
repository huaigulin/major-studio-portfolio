                                        <li>Coming up with Algorithms: users need to come up with algorithms that align with their data. Our tools need to help them with this activity.</li>
                                        <li>Experiments/Testing: when scientists need to prove a theory or formula, they need to test their visualization against new data and the visualization needs to update with data.

                                        <li>Publishing: the generated visualization can be shared with others or published to a platform. And tools should make it easy not only for users to publish, but also for readers to understand/interpret.</li>

                                        <li>Data Collection: depending on their work, users might collect data from experiments or generate input by themselves. Data can take many forms, from numeric values to videos. The amount of data and its complexity may also vary.</li>
                                        <li>Setting Parameters and Variables: users extract variables and parameters from their data.</li>
                                        <li>Coming up with Algorithms: users need to come up with algorithms that align with their data. Our tools need to help them with this activity.</li>
                                        <li>Experiments/Testing: when scientists need to prove a theory or formula, they need to test their visualization against new data and the visualization needs to update with data. When designers need to validate their prototypes, they can test their prototypes in real scenarios.</li>
                                        <li>Generalization/Reproduction/Summary: users should be able to generalize, reproduce, and summarize their findings.</li>

                                        <li>
                                            <p>My interview isn't an exact interview in the sense that I go find someone and ask them some questions. But I'm still able to observe my "interviewee" and her body of knowledge and experience, and help me build my understaning. I "interviewed" an expert (without her consent, unfortunately), by watching her explaining her work process in a video on YouTube. And I think this "interview" is at least equally (or even more) valuable as a real one.</p>

                                            <p>What is this "interview" about?</p>
                                            <p>- Interaction designer <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.synthestruct.com/">Ginger Leigh(Synthestruct)</a> uses TouchDesigner to create an interactive light installation.</p>

                                        <li>
                                            <p>My findings, preliminary conclusions, and more questions:</p>
                                            <p>- While I find Synthestruct's works are absolutely cool and amazing, the amount of coding and algebraic manipulations she went through in TouchDesigner is enormous.</p>
                                            <p>- For most of her works, the output is light in 3D geometric patterns, and input can vary from brain waves, heartbeat, or dataset that produce organized patterns.</p>
                                            <p>- A lot of effort went into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://youtu.be/hrBfmXunf5s?t=1740">coding dynamic simulations</a>.</p>
                                            <p>So my doubts are:</p> 
                                            <p>- Is it really necessary to abstract the geometric patterns in her brain through so many layers of algebraic representations in TouchDesigner?</p>
                                            <p>- Can we achieve more direct manipulations that do not require artists to translate patterns/drawings/ideas in their heads into all kinds of symbols and parameters in a software?</p>
                                            <p>- Do artists have to code? Or is it just because they have bad tools?</p>

                        <p>
                            I really appreciate all the feedbacks that the external critics and my peers had given, they raised questions that I had not thought about before and helped me organize this project around several crucial questions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think for the next few stages of my projects, all the things I need to do are essentially trying to answer 2 questions:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Why do artists and designers need code to begin with?
                            </li>
                            <li>What is the output/experience of my tool?</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            For the first question, I think it is beneficial to draw a line or somewhat distinguish between artists/designers’ work and engineering first. Because in recent experiences of pitching my idea to others, many people would often mistake that my tool would help people build products without any coding at all. This is not true. My tool is impossible to replace all the software developers in the world, and in fact it is not intended to replace any of them. The tool is mainly to help designers and artists to communicate and visualize their ideas to audiences and stakeholders. Therefore, I think it is beneficial to at the beginning of and continuously throughout the project to distinguish between design and engineering. Then we are clear that I want to find out why artists and designers (not engineers) feel that they have to code and how I can help.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then for the first question, my next step is to quantify and categorize the types of work that artists and designers do and their needs. I will interview artists and designers who use coding tools and let them tell stories about how they learned coding and chose the tools that involve coding. This is also related to Daniel’s question of what “materials”, tools, or components are available to artists and what they are working with. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The second question is important because picking the right output/experience of my tool is crucial in proving that coding is unnecessary for digital art making. The experience of my tool should prove, like Daniel said, what I am empowering. Therefore, I think it does not need to be comprehensive in ways that the tool is universal and can be used by all kinds of artists and designers. The output that the tool produces just needs to represent typical art works that are produced in new media, which is dynamic and responsive, and the experience of producing the output is a form of direct manipulation involving immediate feedback. The argument is that it might not be possible to get rid of every scenario that requires artists to code, but a better tool could always be made so they do not have to reinvent the wheels every time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To answer the second question, I think Aaron’s feedback of looking into architectural tools that are user-centered is really helpful, because it can inform me on what a good user experience could look like.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h3>7-in-7 Prototypes</h3>
                        <p>Before starting with prototypes, I spent some time thinking about how I should approach them. I choose p5.js as a starting point.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    p5.js is a terrible tool. That's how I felt every time I need to do a project with it. It is not only a poor way to learn coding, but it is also super inefficient to do dynamic drawing. Why? Think about how you do a drawing with p5: 
                                </p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        First you imagine a shape, such as a circle, in your head or in a sketch on paper. You cannot draw it directly on p5's canvas.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Then you abstract that shape in p5's terms, "circle(x, y, d)". You have to not only memorize (or pull up the reference website to look for) the syntax of the circle formula, which is unnecessary, but also estimate the position of the circle on your canvas, which can rarely be correct at first guess.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        When you want to adjust the position or size of your shape, the manipulation is indirect. For example, you want to make the circle move to the right on your screen for a little. You know how much you want to move, but how much increase in the x value is enough? You have no idea. So you add a number to x and see if the change is enough, then adjust it several times more. This is just bad user experience.
                                    </li>

                                        The relation between time and motion in p5 is abstract and invisible. draw() function makes animations (typically) run at  60 frames per second, but p5 does not provide any visualization connecting motion with time. Therefore implementing every motion in p5 is like solving a math problem.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        On top of that, if we make time change visible, we can then enable another powerful feature: the change of object states and variable values over time by direct manipulation. It is achievable to perform a state or variable change like movement from point A to B, a rotation, or a color update by just doing a few mouse clicks and drags.

                                        For most people, objects, arrays, if-else statements, and for loops are more than enough to create dynamic drawings. These basic data structures and coding logics are easy to visualize and can be done on a graphic UI level. I don't think it's necessary for people to manually write these code and worry about nitty gritties like JavaScript syntax and undefined variables. Unless someone wants to implement a complicated recursion, a merge sort, or a shortest-path algorithm, coding is not needed.

                                    <li>
                                        Then I wonder is it even necessary to think in terms of these coding languages. Arrays and objects are just some containers that hold data. If-else statements are just conditionals. For loops are just repetitions. If I can provide creators with intuitive representations of these commonplace logics, then there's barely any need for coding languages.

                                    I pick p5.js because it is representational of what we shouldn't do with a creative tool. I think many of the rules also apply to other tools. I want to start with a prototype that could solve all the problems of p5, and then during the process, see if I can address shortcomings of other tools.
                                </p>

                                Why do creators need coding at first place? Because coding gives them a toolbox to manipulate input data and produce some forms of output. So as long as I can provide creators with a way to visualize and manipulate data dynamically, there is no need to code. A computer program is just a toolbox that can do different things at different time.

                                I want to start with prototyping my tool as a dynamic illustrator.  Adobe Illustrator(Ai) is a tool that does static, vectorized illustrations. There are online tools that convert Ai drawings to p5.js code. Ai shapes and p5.js shapes are interchangeable. If I can add features to manipulate motions relative to time change, plus some logics that address the needs to shape input, I will have a dynamic illustrator.
